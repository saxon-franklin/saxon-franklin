# About me 



 I’m currently working on developing my skills outside of the GIS and geography world. I would greatly appreciate any help or insight throughout this journey! 
 
 I would love to help you expand your horizons or work through a tough problem! Feel free to ask for help if you're ever mapping.
I’m currently finishing my master's degree in Geography. I am spending a huge amount of time with GIS specifically ArcPro, but I am also learning R! I hope to learn a bit more about Python, SQL, HTML & CSS.
To help me get started I’m looking to collaborate on a small project where I can learn the basics of coding and create positive habits to build from.

The best way to reach me is through LinkedIn where my url is www.linkedin.com/in/saxonfranklin
